Explain what a branch is, in your own words
Just like in a real tree, the code will start in a main branch which is the master branch.
Other branches can be created from the main branch (or even from other branches) and the changes to each can then be isolated from the master and from each other.

Creating branches is useful to keep the master branch stable and usually untouched while the branch/es is where the development and changes continue. A branch can then be merged back to the master when ready.
